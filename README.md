# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

This project performs customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis in Python on a sample e-commerce dataset.

## 📊 Objective

Segment customers based on:
- **Recency** (How recently a customer purchased)
- **Frequency** (How often they purchase)
- **Monetary** (How much they spend)

This helps businesses identify:
- Top & loyal customers
- Customers at risk of churn
- Potential customers to target

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📁 Files

- `Customer_Segmentation_RFM_Analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the full analysis and visualizations

## 📌 Key Steps

1. Load and clean transaction data
2. Calculate RFM metrics
3. Score customers (1 to 4 for each RFM)
4. Segment customers based on total RFM score
5. Visualize customer segments

## 📸 Output Sample

- Bar chart showing customer segments: Top, Loyal, At Risk, Potential
